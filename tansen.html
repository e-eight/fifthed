<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgab8a13a">
<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>Way of the Avatar</dt><dd><p>
(<i>Adapted from /u/Zetesofos's Way of the Four Elements</i>)
</p>

<p>
You follow a monastic tradition that teaches you to harness the elements. When
you focus your ki, you can align yourself with the forces of creation, and
bend the four elements to your will, using them as an extension of your body.
</p>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>Disciple of the Elements</dt><dd><p>
At 3rd level, you learn the <a href="#org98ce47a">Elemental Attunement</a>, the <a href="#org56af929">Elemental Combatant</a>,
and the <a href="#org4f22f6f">Elemental Shield</a> disciplines. You learn two additional elemental
disciplines of your choice at 6th level and again at 11th level, which are
detailed in the <a href="#org5d8c97a">Elemental Disciplines</a> section below. Some disciplines
require you to spend ki points when you use them, and some disciplines
evolve as you get better at mastering the elements. Some disciplines allow
you to cast certain spells, without requiring the material components.
</p>

<p>
Whenever you learn a new elemental discipline, you can also replace one
elemental discipline that you already know with a different discipline.
</p></dd>

<dt>Adept of the Elements</dt><dd>Beginning at 6th level, whenever you target one or more creatures with an
elemental discipline, you can spend 1 ki point to force each creature to
succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed 10 feet and be knocked
prone.</dd>

<dt>Master of the Elements</dt><dd>Starting at 11th level, when you use a cantrip granted by your
<a href="#org98ce47a">Elemental Attunement</a> discipline, you can spend 1 ki point to increase their
area of effect to a number of 5 foot cubes equal to your monk level.</dd>

<dt>Avatar of the Elements</dt><dd><p>
Once you reach 17th level, you are able to become a being of elemental might
for a short period of time. As an action, you may cast one of the following
spells: <a href="#org2bda8a1">Investiture of Flame</a>, <a href="#org1768f70">Investiture of Ice</a>, <a href="#org60774f0">Investiture of Stone</a>,
<a href="#orgcee50ea">Investiture of Wind</a>.
</p>

<p>
When you do so, you do not need to concentrate on the spell. If the spell
requires a creature to make a saving throw, you use your Ki save DC. Once
you use this feature, you cannot do so again until you complete a long rest.
</p></dd>

<dt><a id="org5d8c97a"></a> Elemental Disciplines</dt><dd><dl class="org-dl">
<dt><a id="org98ce47a"></a> Elemental Attunement</dt><dd>You can cast the following cantrips: <a href="#org1af88a7">Control Flames</a>, <a href="#orgdeccf17">Gust</a>, <a href="#org228b32b">Mold Earth</a>,
<a href="#org7f4d888">Shape Water</a>. You use your Ki save DC for any effect that requires a saving
throw.</dd>

<dt>Elemental Barrier (11th level required)</dt><dd><p>
As an action, you can spend 3 ki points to create a wall of elemental
material, consisting of ten 10 feet by 10 feet panels. Each panel must be
contiguous and are 1 foot thick. The wall obscures line of sight and lasts
for 1 minute. The range of ranged weapon attacks that has to pass through
the wall is halved and creatures must succeed on a Strength saving throw
to move through the wall.
</p>

<p>
A creature that starts their turn next to the wall or moves adjacent to it
must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed saving throw, they take
4d8 damage, or half as much on a successful one.
</p>

<p>
Instead of an elemental wall, you can spend 5 ki points to cast
<a href="#org8142482">Wall of Force</a>.
</p></dd>

<dt><a id="org56af929"></a> Elemental Combatant</dt><dd><p>
Beginning at 3rd level, each time you make an unarmed strike or use
elemental discipline, the damage type is your choice of: fire, cold,
thunder, lightning, piercing, slashing, or bludgeoning damage.
</p>

<p>
In addition, the reach of your unarmed strikes increases to 15 feet at 3rd
level, and to 60 feet at 6th level (if you continue with it). This feature
is deactivated whenever you are in the ethereal plane, but on your turn
you can spend 1 ki point to activate it until the start of your next turn.
</p></dd>

<dt>Elemental Defense (6th level required)</dt><dd>Until the start of your next turn when you take the Dodge action, you can
use your reaction to gain one of the following effects when a creature
deals damage to you:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>You can use a single unarmed strike against the triggering creature if
they are within reach.</li>
<li>You can move half your speed without provoking opportunity attacks.</li>
<li>You reduce the triggering attack or spell's damage by half, unless the
damage is psychic damage.</li>
</ul></dd>

<dt><a id="org4f22f6f"></a> Elemental Shield</dt><dd><p>
Starting at 3rd level, as a reaction whenever you or a friendly creature
within 30 feet is targeted by an attack, you can create a temporary
elemental shield to block attacks. The shield provides +2 bonus to the AC
of the targeted creature. The shield dissipates after the attack action is
completed. You can create only one shield at a time.
</p>

<p>
At 3rd level, you gain the ability to levitate a nearby block of earth or
stone to form the shield. If you continue with this discipline then you
gain the following additional abilities at 6th, 11th, and 17th level.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>At 6th level, you gain the ability to freeze the water in
the environment around you to form the shield.</li>
<li>At 11th level, you gain the ability to throw up gusts of air close to
you to form the shield.</li>
<li>At 17th level, you gain the ability to produce flames to form the
shield.</li>
</ul>

<p>
If you are in the ethereal plane, you can spend 1 ki point to produce the
shield out of the ethereal equivalent of the elements.
</p></dd>

<dt>Fist of Four Elements (11th level required)</dt><dd>Whenever you deal damage with an unarmed strike, add half your monk level,
rounded down, to the damage. You can also increase the damage of your
unarmed strikes by spending ki points. Each point you spend, up to a
maximum of 3, increases the damage by your monk die.</dd>

<dt>Leaf on the Wind (11th level required)</dt><dd>When you use Step of the Wind, you can spend 1 ki point and gain a fly
speed equal to your speed until the end of your next turn.</dd>

<dt>Primordial Shackles (6th level required)</dt><dd><p>
When you hit a creature with an unarmed strike, you can spend 1 ki point
to force that creature to make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, the
target is restrained for 1 minuter or until you lose your concentration
(as if you were concentrating on a spell).
</p>

<p>
The creature can use its action to make a Strength check against your Ki
save DC. On a success, it frees itself.
</p></dd>

<dt>Primordial Wrath (11th level required)</dt><dd><p>
As an action, you can produce a huge wave of elemental energy in a 30 foot
cone. Each creature in the 30 foot cone must make a Dexterity saving throw
or take 2d10 damage.
</p>

<p>
You can increase the cone's damage by spending ki points. Each point you
spend, up to maximum of 5, increases the damage by 1d10.
</p></dd>

<dt>Roots of the Land (11th level required)</dt><dd><p>
You reach out with your ki to the ground beneath you. You gain <a href="#org894a6c2">tremorsense</a>
with a range of 30 feet.
</p>

<p>
Also, you can spend 2 ki points to gain a burrowing speed equal to half
your speed until the end of your turn.
</p></dd>

<dt>Shape the Flowing River (6th level required)</dt><dd>You can spend 1 ki point to gain a swim speed equal to your normal speed
for 1 minute. During this time, you can use your action to bring along any
willing creature within 5 feet when you move.</dd>

<dt>Sweeping Elemental Strike (6th level required)</dt><dd>When you use Flurry of Blows, you can spend an additional ki point to make
a single unarmed strike against every creature within 5 feet of you.</dd>

<dt>Zephyr's Embrace (6th level required)</dt><dd>You may use your reaction and spend 1 ki point to extend the benefits of
Slow Fall to any creature within 30 feet of you until the start of your
next turn.</dd>

An invisible wall of force springs into existence at a point you choose within
range. The wall appears in any orientation you choose, as a horizontal or
vertical barrier or at an angle. It can be free floating or resting on a solid
surface. You can form it into a hemispherical dome or a sphere with a radius
of up to 10 feet, or you can shape a flat surface made up of ten
10-foot-by-10-foot panels. Each panel must be contiguous with another
panel. In any form, the wall is 1/4 inch thick. It lasts for the duration. If
the wall cuts through a creature's space when it appears, the creature is
pushed to one side of the wall (your choice which side).
</p>

<p>
Nothing can physically pass through the wall. It is immune to all damage and
can't be dispelled by dispel magic. A disintegrate spell destroys the wall
instantly, however. The wall also extends into the Ethereal Plane, blocking
ethereal travel through the wall.

it was air and without destabilizing it, but you can't end your movement

spell ends, and you are stunned until the end of your next turn.</li>

Until the spell ends, wind whirls around you, and you gain the following
benefits:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Ranged weapon attacks made against you have disadvantage on the attack roll.</li>
<li>You gain a flying speed of 60 feet. If you are still flying when the spell
ends, you fall, unless you can somehow prevent it.</li>
<li>You can use your action to create a 15-foot cube of swirling wind centered
on a point you can see within 60 feet of you. Each creature in that area
must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 2d10 bludgeoning
damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If a
Large or smaller creature fails the save, that creature is also pushed up
to 10 feet away from the center of the cube.</li>
</ul></dd>

<dt><a id="org894a6c2"></a> Tremorsense</dt><dd><p>
A creature with tremorsense can detect and pinpoint the origin of vibrations
within a specific radius, provided that the creature and the source of the
vibrations are in contact with the same ground or substance.
</p>

<p>
Tremorsense can't be used to detect flying or incorporeal creatures. Many
burrowing creatures, such as ankhegs, have this special sense.

<p>
For the duration, you can read the thoughts of certain creatures. When you
cast the spell and as your action on each turn until the spell ends, you can
focus your mind on any one creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. If
the creature you choose has an Intelligence of 3 or lower or doesn’t speak any
language, the creature is unaffected.
</p>

<p>
You initially learn the surface thoughts of the creature – what is most on its
mind in that moment. As an action, you can either shift your attention to
another creature’s thoughts or attempt to probe deeper into the same
creature’s mind. If you probe deeper, the target must make a Wisdom saving
throw. If it fails, you gain insight into its reasoning (if any), its
emotional state, and something that looms large in its mind (such as something
it worries over, loves, or hates). If it succeeds, the spell ends. Either way,
the target knows that you are probing into its mind, and unless you shift your
attention to another creature’s thoughts, the creature can use its action on
its turn to make an Intelligence check contested by your Intelligence check;
if it succeeds, the spell ends.
</p>

<p>
Questions verbally directed at the target creature naturally shape the course
of its thoughts, so this spell is particularly effective as part of an
interrogation. You can also use this spell to detect the presence of thinking
creatures you can’t see. When you cast the spell or as your action during the
duration, you can search for thoughts within 30 feet of you. The spell can
penetrate barriers, but 2 feet of rock, 2 inches of any metal other than lead,
or a thin sheet of lead blocks you. You can’t detect a creature with an
Intelligence of 3 or lower or one that doesn’t speak any language.
</p>

<p>
Once you detect the presence of a creature in this way, you can read its
thoughts for the rest of the duration as described above, even if you can’t
see it, but it must still be within range.

"<i>Tansen, Taaannnsennn, &#x2026;." a oddly familiar voice called him, amidst all the</i>
<i>din. He could not quite place where it was coming from, nor whose voice it</i>
<i>was. He knew the speaker was calling him, but that was not his name. He was</i>
<i>Sohandus. Then why did the voice did not call him as such? His reptilian brain</i>
<i>could not figure that out. Reptilian! Why was he thinking of himself as a</i>
<i>reptile? Sure he had wings, but they were the wings of an angel not of a</i>
<i>wyvern. No</i>! <i>None of that mattered now. Angel, wyverns, the voice, the crowd</i>,
<i>none of that mattered. Nothing except the "Lady of the Blades", standing between</i>
<i>them and their salvation, mattered. And here comes her first salvo.</i>
</p>

<p>
Tansen woke up. The window was open, and sunlight was streaming on to his
face. He realized his mother was calling him down for breakfast. He glanced at
the clock on the nightstand. It was seven. He would have to get out of bed
soon. He could not be late again. The Chief had already threatened once to
dock his pay for the month. If he was late again then he might actually do
it. And Tansen could not afford that. He was tired of hearing what a shame to
the clan he was. Tired of hearing how his siblings were working hard to bring
glory to the clan while he could only be a sergeant of the city watch. Imagine
being an unpaid sergeant of the city watch. Tansen shivered at the thought of
that.
</p>

<p>
Bu the dream. The dreams. They had started about a few months back. In the
beginning the dreams would appear once in a while, then every week, then thrice a
week, and finally they reached a crescendo last week. Every night last week he
had had those dreams. Even the blue wine did not help. Just made the dreams more
intense. In the dreams he was always in a bleak world. The colors were muted,
nothing like his shiny red scales. The air was hot and heavy, not that he minded
the heat. Nothing should have been able to grow there, and yet there was
life. Though not life as he knew. And he had companions. After dreaming them for
a few months, he finally knew their names. Soraya, the angel. Nathan, the
human, even though he garbed strangely. Ragnarok, the demon? He was not quite
sure what Ragnarok was. And he was Sohandus of the angelic wings. This was a
most strange party. But the dreams were so real. Not like the fantasies he had
as a youngling. This was not Tansen pretending to be Frejya, the barbarian
princess who singlehandedly drove back the fire demons that had invaded her
country, or Ingotfoundersson, the famous dwarf adventurer who discovered the
adamantine mines of Minerva. No, Sohandus was very real. Tansen was Sohandus. Or
so it seemed in the dreams.
</p>

<p>
The worst part of the dreams, besides always having to fight for survival in
that bleak world, was that Tansen had no one to talk to about it. His father had
never liked his flights of fancy, and had put an early stop to it. The senior
dragonborn's pride could not tolerate his son playacting as fairy tale
characters instead of working for glory of the clan. Tansen could not talk to
his father about the dreams. He could not talk to his mother, may Io bless her,
either. He knew what she would say, and Tansen would rather lose all his scales
than visit the bard at Fandort-upon-Tye. His siblings are away changing the
world, and even if they were here they would probably have been too busy
picking on him to help him. Nor could he discuss this with his non-dragonborn
colleagues. That is not the dragonborn way, even for the most atypical
dragonborn like Tansen.
</p>

<p>
Tansen heard his mother call him down again for breakfast. It was a quarter past
seven. There was no way he was going to be late today too. He got out of bed,
and headed downstairs. Maybe he will stop by the library at the new monastery
after work. The manuscripts might have some answers.
